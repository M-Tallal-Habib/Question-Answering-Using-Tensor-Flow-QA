Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 .

, or brand awareness .',\n"," 'Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database .',\n"," 'The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant s relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third party ads .',\n"," 'Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century .',\n"," 'Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective .',\n"," 'In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) .',\n"," 'This email resulted in 13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails .',\n"," 'However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs .',\n"," 'In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software .',\n"," 'This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns .',\n"," 'Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined .',\n"," 'Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency .',\n"," 'Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel s scope .',\n"," 'At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured .',\n"," 'Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer s action with a company .',\n"," 'To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications primary purpose must be to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging .',\n"," 'Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts .',\n"," 'The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it .',\n"," 'But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 compared to 36.6 for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers to anticipate and answer questions or to cross sell or up sell products or services .',\n"," 'Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails .',\n"," 'There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) .',\n"," 'Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) .',\n"," 'Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies .',\n"," 'Safe mail marketing is also used .',\n"," 'Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets .',\n"," 'Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer .',\n"," 'However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes .',\n"," 'Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient s behavior .',\n"," 'Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy .',\n"," 'There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail .',\n"," 'Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons An exact return on investment can be tracked ( track to basket ) and has proven to be high when done properly .',\n"," 'Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic .',\n"," 'Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing .',\n"," 'Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients .',\n"," 'The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior .',\n"," 'Email provides a cost effective method to test different marketing content , including

check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates .',\n"," 'Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 in 2009 to 292 million in the UK .',\n"," 'If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e commerce businesses .',\n"," 'As of mid 2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers .',\n"," 'According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 in the U.S. six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 were missing .',\n"," 'This lags behind other countries Australia delivers at 90 , Canada at 89 , Britain at 88 , France at 84 , Germany at 80

Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider s acceptable use policy .',\n"," 'Opt in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it .',\n"," 'This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing .',\n"," 'Opt in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver .',\n"," 'This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers .',\n"," 'If opt in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be anticipated .',\n"," 'It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer .',\n"," 'Ideally , opt in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements .',\n"," 'A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm s customers .',\n"," 'Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products .',\n"," 'In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter .',\n"," 'With a foundation of opted in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders known as drip marketing .',\n"," 'They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments .',\n"," 'The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as ACMA .',\n"," 'The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information .',\n"," 'Fines range with 3 fines of AU 110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) .',\n"," 'The Canada Anti Spam Law ( CASL ) went into effect on

2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications .',\n"," 'Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes .',\n"," 'The Directive establishes the opt in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient this does not apply to business email addresses

and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication .',\n"," 'The CAN SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e mails .',\n"," 'Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them .',\n"," 'The act authorizes a US 16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient .',\n"," 'However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are materially false or misleading .',\n"," 'In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling .',\n"," 'As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act .',\n"," 'A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act .',\n"," 'To comply with the act s regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission .',\n"," 'In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns .',\n"," 'The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well

insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation .',\n"," 'Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm

diploid cell , known as zygote .',\n"," 'The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism .',\n"," 'Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical

which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa .',\n"," 'At the beginning of the process , the sperm undergoes a series of changes , as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize .',\n"," 'The sperm must undergo capacitation in the female s reproductive tract over several hours , which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane , preparing it for the acrosome reaction , the enzymatic penetration of the egg s tough membrane , the zona pellucida , which surrounds the oocyte .',\n"," 'After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra cellular matrix of glycoproteins .',\n"," 'A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida .',\n"," 'This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida .',\n"," 'Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells .',\n"," 'As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort .',\n"," 'It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection .',\n"," 'Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process .',\n"," 'Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs .',\n"," 'Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida .',\n"," 'This in turn causes the glyco proteins in the zona pellucida to cross link with each other i.e.',\n"," 'the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm .',\n"," 'This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm .',\n"," 'The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg .',\n"," 'After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg .',\n"," 'The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body .',\n"," 'The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material .',\n"," 'The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place .',\n"," 'In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes .',\n"," 'The oocyte completes its second meiotic division .',\n"," 'This results in a mature ovum .',\n"," 'The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process , to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization .',\n"," 'The sperm s tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus .',\n"," 'This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin .',\n"," 'Still , a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring .',\n"," 'The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte , rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division .',\n"," 'Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse ( half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome ) .',\n"," 'Their membranes dissolve , leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes .',\n"," 'During this dissolution , a mitotic spindle forms between them .',\n"," 'The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm .',\n"," 'Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis ( which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase ) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together .',\n"," 'Thus , the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes .',\n"," 'Each of the two daughter cells resulting from that mitosis has one replica of each chromatid that was replicated in the previous stage .',\n"," 'Thus , they are genetically identical .',\n"," 'Fertilization is the event most commonly used to mark the zero point in descriptions of prenatal development of the embryo or fetus .',\n"," 'The resultant age is known as fertilization age , fertilizational age , embryonic age , fetal age or ( intrauterine ) developmental ( IUD ) age .',\n"," 'Gestational age , in contrast , takes the beginning of the last menstrual period ( LMP ) as the zero point .',\n"," 'By convention , gestational age is calculated by adding 14 days to fertilization age and vice versa .',\n"," 'In fact , however , fertilization usually occurs within a day of ovulation , which , in turn , occurs on average 14.6 days after the beginning of the preceding menstruation ( LMP ) .',\n"," 'There is also considerable variability in this interval , with a 95 prediction interval of the ovulation of 9 to 20 days after menstruation even for an average woman who has a mean LMP to ovulation time of 14.6 .',\n"," 'In a reference group representing all women , the 95 prediction interval of the LMP to ovulation is 8.2 to 20.5 days .',\n"," 'The average time to birth has been estimated to be 268 days ( 38 weeks and two days ) from ovulation , with a standard deviation of 10 days or coefficient of variation of 3.7 .',\n"," 'Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally ( after birth ) as well to estimate various risk factors .',\n"," 'For example , it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation .',\n"," 'Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process .',\n"," 'Polyspermy results from multiple sperm fertilizing an egg .',\n"," 'However , some researchers have found that in rare pairs of fraternal twins , their origin might have been from the fertilization of one egg cell from the mother and eight sperm cells from the father .',\n"," 'This possibility has been investigated by computer simulations of the fertilization process .NFL lists Current season ( show ) 2017 season Quarterbacks ( show ) Starting quarterbacks by

2018 ) Roanoke Colony Colony of England 1585 c. 1590 Virginea Pars map , drawn by John White during his initial visit in 1585 .',\n"," 'Roanoke is the small pink island in the middle right of the map .',\n"," 'History Established 1585 Birth of Virginia Dare August 18 , 1587 Abandoned Before August c. 1590 Found abandoned August 18 , 1590 Population 1587 116 Today part of United States Dare County , North Carolina The Roanoke Colony ( ro no k ) , also known as the Lost Colony , was established in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is today s Dare County , North Carolina .',\n"," 'It was a late 16th century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America .',\n"," 'The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh .',\n"," 'The colonists disappeared during the Anglo Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England .',\n"," 'Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname The Lost Colony .',\n"," 'There is no conclusive evidence as to what happened to the colonists .',\n"," 'The enterprise was originally financed and organized by Sir Humphrey Gilbert , who drowned in 1583 returning from a voyage to the fishing settlement at St. John s , Newfoundland .',\n"," 'Sir Humphrey Gilbert s half brother Sir Walter Raleigh later gained his brother s charter from the Queen and subsequently executed the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville , Raleigh s distant cousin .',\n"," 'On March 25 , 1584 , Queen Elizabeth I granted Raleigh a charter for the colonization of the area of North America .',\n"," 'This charter specified that Raleigh needed to establish a colony in North America , or lose his right to colonization .',\n"," 'The Queen and Raleigh intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World .',\n"," 'The queen s charter said that Raleigh was supposed to discover , search , find out , and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands , Countries , and territories ... to have , hold , occupy , and enjoy .',\n"," 'The queen s charter also said that Raleigh was supposed to establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain .',\n"," 'The purpose of these raids was to tell Spain that England was ready for war .',\n"," 'The original charter basically told Raleigh to establish a military base to counteract the activities of the Spaniards .',\n"," 'Raleigh himself never visited North America , although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to South America s Orinoco River basin in search of the legendary golden city of El Dorado .',\n"," 'On April 27 , 1584 , Raleigh dispatched an expedition led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore the eastern coast of North America .',\n"," 'They arrived on Roanoke Island on July 4 and soon established relations with the local natives , the Secotans and Croatans .',\n"," 'Barlowe returned to England with two Croatans named Manteo and Wanchese , who were able to describe the politics and geography of the area to Raleigh .',\n"," 'Based on the information given , Raleigh organized a second expedition , to be led by Sir Richard Grenville .',\n"," 'Grenville s fleet departed Plymouth on April 9 , 1585 , with five main ships Tiger ( Grenville s ) , Roebuck , Red Lion , Elizabeth , and Dorothy .',\n"," 'A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated Tiger from the rest of the fleet .',\n"," 'The captains had a contingency plan if they were separated , which was to meet up again in Puerto Rico , and Tiger arrived in the Baye of Muskito ( Guayanilla Bay ) on May 11 .',\n"," 'While waiting for the other ships , Grenville established relations with the resident Spanish while simultaneously engaging in some privateering against them .',\n"," 'He also built a fort .',\n"," 'Elizabeth arrived soon after the fort s construction .',\n"," 'Grenville eventually tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on June 7 .',\n"," 'The fort was abandoned , and its location remains unknown .',\n"," 'Tiger sailed through Ocracoke Inlet on June 26 , but it struck a shoal , ruining most of the food supplies .',\n"," 'The expedition succeeded in repairing the ship and , in early July , reunited with Roebuck and Dorothy , which had arrived in the Outer Banks with Red Lion some weeks previous .',\n"," 'Red Lion had dropped off its passengers and left for Newfoundland for privateering .',\n"," 'During the initial exploration of the mainland coast and the native settlements , the Europeans blamed the natives of the village of Aquascogoc for stealing a silver cup .',\n"," 'As retaliation , the settlers sacked and burned the village .',\n"," 'English writer and courtier Richard Hakluyt s contemporaneous reports also describe this incident .',\n"," '( Hakluyt s reports of the first voyage to Roanoke were compiled from accounts by various financial backers , including Sir Walter Raleigh .',\n"," 'Hakluyt himself never traveled to the New World . )',\n"," 'Despite this incident and a lack of food , Grenville decided to leave Ralph Lane and 107 men to establish a colony at the north end of Roanoke Island , promising to return in April 1586 with more men and fresh supplies .',\n"," 'The group disembarked on August 17 , 1585 , and built a small fort on the island .',\n"," 'There are no surviving renderings of the Roanoke fort , but it was likely similar in structure to the one in Guayanilla Bay .',\n"," 'Grenville in the Tiger on only his seventh day of sail captured ( after a three day battle ) a rich Spanish galleon , Santa Maria de San Vicente off Bermuda which he took with him as a prize back to England .',\n"," 'As April 1586 passed , there was no sign of Grenville s relief fleet .',\n"," 'Meanwhile , in June , bad blood resulted from the destruction of the village , and this spurred an attack on the fort by the local Native Americans , which the colonists were able to repel .',\n"," 'Soon after the attack , Sir Francis Drake was on his way home from a successful raid in the Caribbean , and he stopped at the colony and offered to take the colonists back to England .',\n"," 'Several accepted , including metallurgist Joachim Gans .',\n"," 'On this return voyage , the Roanoke colonists introduced tobacco , maize , and potatoes to England .',\n"," 'The relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake s departure with the colonists .',\n"," 'Finding the colony abandoned , Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force , leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh s claim to Roanoke Island .',\n"," 'In 1587 , Raleigh dispatched a new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony on Chesapeake Bay .',\n"," 'They were led by John White , an artist and friend of Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expedition to Roanoke , and was appointed governor of the 1587 colony .',\n"," 'White and Raleigh named 12 assistants to aid in the settlement .',\n"," 'They were ordered to stop at Roanoke to pick up the small contingent left there by Grenville the previous year , but when they arrived on July 22 , 1587 , they found nothing except a skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the English garrison .',\n"," 'When they could find no one , the master pilot Simon Fernandez refused to let the colonists return to the ships , insisting that they establish the new colony on Roanoke .',\n"," 'His motives remain unclear , however , and new evidence offered by author Brandon Fullam indicates not only that Fernandez had good reason for his actions , but that the decision to alter the Chesapeake Bay destination had already been agreed to prior to their arrival at Roanoke .',\n"," 'White re established relations with the Croatan and other local tribes , but those with whom Lane had fought previously refused to meet with him .',\n"," 'Shortly thereafter , colonist George Howe was killed by a native while searching alone for crabs in Albemarle Sound .',\n"," 'The colonists persuaded Governor White to return to England to explain the colony s desperate situation and ask for help .',\n"," 'Left behind were about 115 colonists the remaining men and women who had made the Atlantic crossing plus White s newly born granddaughter Virginia Dare , the first English child born in the Americas .',\n"," 'White sailed for England in late 1587 , although crossing the Atlantic at that time of year was a considerable risk .',\n"," 'Plans for a relief fleet were delayed first by the captain s refusal to return during the winter , and then the attack on England of the Spanish Armada and the subsequent Anglo Spanish War .',\n"," 'Every able English ship joined the fight , leaving White without a means to return to Roanoke at the time .',\n"," 'In the spring of 1588 , White managed to acquire two small vessels and sailed for Roanoke however , his attempt to return was thwarted when the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward bound voyage ( in order to improve their profits ) .',\n"," 'They themselves were captured and their cargo seized .',\n"," 'With nothing left to deliver to the colonists , the ships returned to England .',\n"," 'Because of the continuing war with Spain , White was unable to mount another resupply attempt for an additional three years .',\n"," 'He finally gained passage on a privateering expedition organised by John Watts and Walter Raleigh .',\n"," 'They agreed to stop off at Roanoke on the way back after raiding the Spanish in the Caribbean .',\n"," 'White landed on August 18 , 1590 , on his granddaughter s third birthday , but found the settlement deserted .',\n"," 'His men could not find any trace of the 90 men , 17 women , and 11 children , nor was there any sign of a struggle or battle .',\n"," 'The only clue was the word CROATOAN carved into a post of the fence around the village , and the letters C R O carved into a nearby tree .',\n"," 'All the houses and fortifications had been dismantled , which meant that their departure had not been hurried .',\n"," 'Before he had left the colony , White instructed the colonists that , if anything happened to them , they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby , indicating that their absence had been forced .',\n"," 'There was no cross , and White took this to mean that they had moved to Croatoan Island ( now known as Hatteras Island ) , but he was unable to conduct a search .',\n"," 'A massive storm was forming and his men refused to go any farther the next day , they left .',\n"," 'Born in 1560 , Thomas Harriot entered Raleigh s employment in the early 1580s , after graduating from the University of Oxford .',\n"," 'Harriot may have been among the men of Arthur Barlowe s 1584 expedition of the colony .',\n"," 'He trained the members of Raleigh s first Roanoke expedition in navigational skills and eventually sailed to Roanoke with the second group of settlers , where his skills as a naturalist became particularly important along with those of painter and settlement leader John White .',\n"," 'Between their arrival in Roanoke in April 1585 and the July 1586 departure , Harriot and White both conducted detailed studies of the Roanoke area , with Harriot compiling his samples and notes into several notebooks that did not survive the colony s disappearance .',\n"," 'Harriot also wrote descriptions of the surrounding flora and fauna of the area , which survive in his work A Brief and True Report of the New Founde Land of Virginia , written as a report on the colony s progress to the English government on the request of Raleigh .',\n"," 'Viewed by modern historians as propaganda for the colony , this work has become vastly important to Roanoke s history due to Harriot s observations on wildlife as well as his depictions of Indian activities at the time of the colony s disappearance .',\n"," 'Harriot reports that relations between the Roanoke Indians and the English settlers were mutually calm and prosperous , contradicting other historical evidence that catalogs the bloody struggles between the Roanoke Indians and both of Raleigh s commanders , Sir Richard Grenville and his successor , Ralph Lane .',\n"," 'Harriot recounts little to none of these accounts in his report to England and does not mention the disorderly state of the colony under either Grenville s or Lane s tenure , correctly assuming these facts would prevent Roanoke from gaining more settlers .',\n"," 'Harriot s text did not reach England , or the English press , until 1588 , by which time the fate of the Lost Colony was sealed in all but name .',\n"," 'Twelve years went by before Raleigh decided to find out what happened to his colony .',\n"," 'Led by Samuel Mace , this 1602 expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering .',\n"," 'However , Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip , and Mace s ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England .',\n"," 'By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists , the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island .',\n"," 'By this time , having been arrested for treason , Raleigh was unable to send any further missions .',\n"," 'There was one final expedition in 1603 led by Bartholomew Gilbert with the intention of finding Roanoke colonists .',\n"," 'Their intended destination was Chesapeake Bay , but bad weather forced them to land in an unspecified location near there .',\n"," 'The landing team , including Gilbert himself , was killed by a group of Native Americans for unknown reasons on July 29 .',\n"," 'The remaining crew were forced to return to England empty handed .',\n"," 'Meanwhile , the Spanish had different reasons for wanting to find the colony .',\n"," 'Knowing of Raleigh s plans to use Roanoke as a base for privateering , they were hoping to destroy it .',\n"," 'Moreover , they had been getting mostly inaccurate reports of activities there , and they imagined the colony to be far more successful than it actually was .',\n"," 'In 1590 , they found the remnants of the colony purely by accident , but assumed it was only an outlying base of the main settlement , which they believed was in the Chesapeake Bay area ( John White s intended location ) .',\n"," 'But just as the Anglo Spanish War prevented White from returning in a timely manner , Spanish authorities in the New World could not muster enough support back home for such a venture .',\n"," 'Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607 , efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke .',\n"," 'The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith , leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 .',\n"," 'According to chronicler Samuel Purchas , Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians , a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present day South Hampton Roads sub region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans .',\n"," 'This shocking information was reported to England and by the spring of 1609 , King James and the Royal Council were convinced that Chief Powhatan was responsible for the slaughter of the Lost Colony .',\n"," 'The second source of Chief Powhatan s involvement was William Strachey , Secretary of the Jamestown colony in 1610 11 .',\n"," 'Strachey s The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia seemed to confirm Smith s report and provided additional information the colonists had been living peacefully among a group of natives beyond Powhatan s domain for more than twenty years when they were massacred .',\n"," 'Furthermore , Powhatan himself seemed to have directed the slaughter because of prophecies by his priests that he would be overthrown by people from that area , and he reportedly produced several English made iron implements to back his claim .',\n"," 'The information from these two sources , John Smith and William Strachey , provides the basis for the traditional view that the Lost Colony was slaughtered by Chief Powhatan , and versions of the Powhatan Lost Colony slaughter scenario have persisted for more than 400 years .',\n"," 'However , no bodies were found and no archaeological evidence has been found to support this claim .',\n"," 'Furthermore , recent re examination of the Smith and Strachey sources advanced by author and researcher Brandon Fullam has suggested that the massacre described by Powhatan was actually of the 15 people left behind by the first Roanoke expedition , leaving the fate of the second colony still unknown .',\n"," 'As per Smith s and Strachey s reports , Dr. David Beers Quinn theorized that the colonists moved north to integrate with the Chesepians that Chief Powhatan claimed to have killed .',\n"," 'To make the journey northward , Quinn believed that they used the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings .',\n"," 'Naturally , if that were the mode of transportation , the colonists could have gone to live in other locations as well .',\n"," 'In her 2000 book Roanoke Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony , historian Lee Miller postulated that some of the Lost Colony survivors sought shelter with the Chowanoke , who were attacked by another tribe , identified by the Jamestown Colony as the Mandoag ( an Algonquian name commonly given to enemy nations ) .',\n"," 'The Mandoag are believed to be either the Tuscarora , an Iroquois speaking tribe , or the Eno , also known as the Wainoke .',\n"," 'The so called Zuniga Map ( named for Pedro de Z iga , the Spanish ambassador to England , who had secured a copy and passed it on to Philip III of Spain ) , drawn about 1607 by the Jamestown settler Francis Nelson , also gives credence to this claim .',\n"," 'The map states four men clothed that came from roonock were living in an Iroquois site on the Neuse .',\n"," 'William Strachey wrote that , at the Indian settlements of Peccarecanick and Ochanahoen , there were reportedly two story houses with stone walls .',\n"," 'The Indians supposedly had learned how to build them from the Roanoke settlers .',\n"," 'In both cases , as stated above , it is equally possible that these were survivors of Chief Powhatan s attack on the first Jamestown colonists .',\n"," 'There were also reported sightings of European captives at various Indian settlements during the same
